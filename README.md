Processing &amp; analysis of data  from 2023 survey of Essex Estuaries SAC

## Monitoring summary
* 63 survey points sampled with Day grabs
** at 13 of these stations, 3 replicate grabs were gathered
** in total therefore: (13*3) + (63-13) = 89 grab samples were gathered
* samples were analysed for PSA and [macro?]faunal abundances (what about biomass?)

## TO DO list
* within each biotope, do PSA values/abundances differ by year?
* Currently splitting data by BSH and comparing univariate and multivariate data by Year.
  * Waterbody ID is potentially a confounding factor. e.g. are A5.2 assemblages in Colne likely to differ from A5.2 assemblages in Blackwater?
  * investigate previous report (2017) to see what investigations were carried out

## Things to note
* ~~MVABUND graph outputs display 'significant' taxa between years at the alpha=0.1 level~~
* ~~replicate samples were assessed using an offset term~~
